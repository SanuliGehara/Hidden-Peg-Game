# Hidden Peg Game

This is a console based application using Python. The game is between the code maker who utilizes the software and the code breaker who plays the game by guessing 4-digit numbers to break the hidden number. 

The system will play as the code maker, and it secretly puts 4 colored pegs (The System generates a 4-digit random number where each digit is from range 1 to 6 and each number represents a color. E.g., 1- White, 2-Blue, 3-Red, 
4 â€“Yellow, 5-Green, 6- Purple). The code breaker (user) has eight attempts to guess the hidden random number.
